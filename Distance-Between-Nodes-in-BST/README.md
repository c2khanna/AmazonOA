## Distance Between Nodes in BST

Given a list of unique integers `nums`, construct a BST from it (you need to insert nodes one-by-one with the given order to get the BST) and find the distance between two nodes `node1` and `node2`. Distance is the number of edges between two nodes. If any of the given nodes does not appear in the BST, return `-1`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 1, 3], node1 = 1, node2 = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
     2
   /   \
  1     3
```
