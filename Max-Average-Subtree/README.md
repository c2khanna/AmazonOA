## Maximum Average Subtree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

### Example 1:

```
Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation:
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
```

### Note:

There is another variation to this question that can ask to return the root node of the max Average subtree
